This is a two player game programmed in JavaFx platform using Intellij Idea as a part of an online course.
JavaFx is a combination of Java and XML.Here we use Java for backend and XML for frontend development.
The simplset way to run this game is to download any IDE supporting JVM, paste the code and run it.

                                or,
                                
We can directly download the jar file that I uploaded and enjoy the game.

The rules to can be found inside the Help menu at the top left of the game screen.
