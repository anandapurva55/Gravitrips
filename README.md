This is a two player game programmed in JavaFx platform using Intellij Idea as a part of an online course.
JavaFx is used for Desktop Application Development and is a combination of Java and FXML.Here we use Java for backend and FXML for frontend development.
The simplet way to run this game is to download any IDE supporting JVM, paste the code and run it. 

                                or,
                                
We can directly download the jar file that I uploaded and enjoy the game.
